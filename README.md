# vagrant-ansible
Base script to generate a local cluster with ansible playbooks.

This is very basic and used to fasten our local labs. It should not be used in prod or for serious work. There's probably a bunch of security issues like the ssh-pass usage and performances might be poor considering the very limited resources allocated to the machines.

The comments in the file should be pretty straightforward.
